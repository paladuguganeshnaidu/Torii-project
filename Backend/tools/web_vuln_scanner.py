Web Vulnerability Scanner - REMOVED

This module has been intentionally disabled/removed. Keeping a lightweight
stub here prevents import errors in environments that still try to import
the module. Any attempt to instantiate the scanner will raise a RuntimeError
explaining that the tool was removed.
